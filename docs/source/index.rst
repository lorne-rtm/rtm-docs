Raptoreum Documentation
=======================

Welcome to the Raptoreum Documentation! These "docs" will cover everything from the basics, to advanced use, to docs for developers looking to build on `Raptoreum <https://raptoreum.com>`_ (RTM). Raptoreum is looking to solve issues tha are apparent in other Blockchain projects through innovation. 
RTM is a POW (Proof of Work) based Blockchain which is ASIC and FPGA resistant, and cn be mined on common hardware (CPU / GPU) which incrases and encourages decentralization. It also offers an alternativ way to contribute to the network and earn passive income through collateralized Smartnodes.

.. note:: This documentation is consantly evolving and being added to. Please do let us know on `Discord <https://discord.gg/raptoreum>`_ if there is something you think should be added.

    .. tab-item:: Decentralization

        Raptoreum employs GhostRider, a custom Proof of Work (POW) algorithm designed to resist ASIC and FPGA mining hardware. This strategic choice ensures that mining Raptoreum (RTM) remains accessible to everyone, using standard computing equipment. By avoiding the centralization risks associated with specialized mining hardware, Raptoreum fosters a more decentralized network. This inclusivity not only broadens participation but also enhances the network's resilience against censorship and attacks, reinforcing the core principles of blockchain technology.
