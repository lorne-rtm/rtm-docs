Smartnodes
==========

Smartnodes are a special type of Raptoreum node which usually are run on a VPS or dedicated server.
Smartnodes help secure and expand the Raptoreum networks capabilities, they enable the following features.

- 51% protection / double spend attack
- InstantSend, transactions fully confirmed within seconds
- Chainlocks, these are what make the above two features possible
- Store and execute Smart Contracts (development)
- Run side chain for transaction decoupling (development)

They also contribute to the network in the same way as other Raptoreumcore
full nodes such as:

- Block and transaction validation and propagation
- Serving chaindata to other nodes

Anybody can setup and operate a Smartnode helping strengthen aand decentralize the network and earning passive income as reward for doing so. Smartnodes need to show their commitment to the network by locking up a collateral of 1.8 million RTM. A VPS or dedicated server with a static IPv4 is also required. Smartnodes are paid for their service from block rewards as wll as a percentage from special transactions.

- Block reward 20%
- 80% of transaction fees from futures transactions and asset transactions.
- They will also be paid in the future for Smart Contracts storage and execution.
