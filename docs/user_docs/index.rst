Raptoreum is an innovative cryptocurrency platform designed to democratize blockchain technology and address common challenges faced by traditional blockchains. It emphasizes decentralization, security, and scalability, supporting both fungible and non-fungible assets, alongside smart contracts.

Central to Raptoreum is its GhostRider consensus algorithm, which is ASIC and FPGA resistant, ensuring that mining remains accessible to individuals with standard computing hardware. This approach not only promotes wider participation in the network's security but also reinforces the platform's resistance to centralization and censorship.
